<p class="p">Eating out can be a very pleasurable experience. Having dinner with a friend, eating a romantic meal while on a date or celebrating some special event with a party at a restaurant are all things we enjoy doing. Even so, there are few people who eat out all the time and eating at home has many points in its favor. It is cheaper to eat at home. It is healthier to eat at home and it is usually much more comfortable. For me, there is no doubt that I prefer eating at home. Firstly, eating at home is much less expensive than eating in a restaurant. Obviously, when we eat at home we do the preparation, cooking and serving of the food ourselves and, therefore, do not need to pay the labor costs of cook, waiter and other restaurant staff.
Similarly, we have no other overheads to pay for such as restaurant rent and high utility bills.</p>
